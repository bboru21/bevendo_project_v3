Ciao {{first_name}},<br />

<p>At long last, Bevendo is now a website, and you can check it out here:</p>

<a href="https://bevendo.app">https://bevendo.app</a>

<p>And as a member of this distribution list, you can login with the following credentials:</p>

<pre>
User Name: {{username}}
Password: {{password}}
</pre>

<p>There you can view upcoming feasts and Virginia ABC pricing info, search for feasts/cocktails/ingredients, and even add recipes to your favorites!</p>

<p>Just a note that though the codebase is secure, the site does not yet use HTTPS protocol, and  I would advise against changing your password to anyting sensitive.</p>

Salute,<br />
Bryan
