Ciao {{first_name}},

At long last, Bevendo is now a website, and you can check it out here:

http://bevendo.app

And as a member of this distribution list, you can login with the following credentials:

User Name: {{username}}
Password: {{password}}

There you can view upcoming feasts and Virginia ABC pricing info, search for feasts/cocktails/ingredients, and even add recipes to your favorites!

Just a note that though the codebase is secure, the site does not yet use HTTPS protocol, and  I would advise against changing your password to anyting sensitive.

Salute,

Bryan
